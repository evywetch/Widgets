  /*
  NOTE: To make use of "useEffect" inside of the component, we call useEffect() and provide a function as 1st argument. The KEY of useEffect() is that we have to configure it to tell it when we want our code to be executed, can choose 1 of 3 options. Configure it to tell it when we want the function in the 1st arguent to be executed.
  SUM:
  1st argument = the function we want to execute.
  2nd argument = when do we want the 1st argument to be executed, an array, can be nothing, an empty array or an array that has data in it.
    => [] = Run at initial render
    => ..nothing.. = Run at initial render AND Run after every rerender(rerender = the whole code in the component is executed)
    => [data] = Run at initial render AND un after every rerender if at least one data(datas provided in an array) has changed since last render(we can put more than 1 data in this array)
    NOTE: => ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ We are not allowed to mark the function that are passing into useEffect() as "async" and use any "await" keyword directly inside that function
        => We have to use some alternative solutions, there 3 difeerent ways to make requests inside useEffect():
            => 1. Make an "async" function inside the function that are passing into useEffect(), and use this function to do API request. Like wat we do in the code.
    NOTE: The pair" key value " that we put in "params" object, will be our query string based on this standard URL: en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=search&format=json&srsearch=SEARCHTERM
    NOTE: href={`https://en.wikipedia.org?curid=${result.pageid}`} is the link where to find that particular info in wikipedia site
    NOTE: ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ We make use of 2 useEffect to avoid the warning bcoz of using 2 pieces of state(term, results) in the same useEffect() and unecessary api request, see reason in section12, video 170
